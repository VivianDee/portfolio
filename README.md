# Flask Project README

## Overview
This is a simple Flask application that serves a front-end interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application demonstrates basic routing and rendering of templates in Flask.

## Project Structure
The project directory structure is as follows:

```
/flask_project
    /static
        script.js            # JavaScript file
    /templates
        index.html           # HTML template
    app.py                   # Flask application file
    README.md                # This README file
```

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install Flask, the only dependency for this project, using pip:
   ```
   pip install Flask
   ```

## Running the Application
1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:  
   ```
   cd flask_project
   ```

2. **Run the Flask Application**:  
   Execute the `app.py` file to start the Flask development server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:  
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to view the application.

## Usage
- The Flask application serves a single HTML page (`index.html`) located in the `/templates` directory.
- The front-end interface is enhanced with JavaScript (`script.js`) located in the `/static` directory.
- Modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed to customize the front-end behavior and appearance.
- Define additional routes and views in `app.py` to extend the functionality of the application.
